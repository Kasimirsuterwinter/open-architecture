# Open Architecture license

Open Source license for Architecture and construction industry to allow free knowledge and information sharing.

Benefits of using OAL:
* Share architectural works freely
* No liability
* Recieve credit and recognition for derivative works

Why do we need a license for architecture?

* Architecture isn't software or content. Architecture can be expressed in blueprints (source) or the built form, but in it's built form it's not distributed.
* Creative commons and software licenses regards the built form as a derivative of the blueprints and the license applies to the structure. This means that the client is free to distribute the work.
* Architects need a license that is flexible and allows them to sell their work without any restrictions.
