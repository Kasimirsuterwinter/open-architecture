Open license allows free knowledge and information sharing in the architecture and construction industry. The open-source revolution helps professionals to use and create better designs, better profitability and reduced cost by providing a libre sharing economy.

Benefits of using OAL:

Why do we need a license for architecture?

* Architecture isn't software or content. Architecture can be expressed in blueprints (source) or the built form, but in it's built form it's not distributed.
* Creative commons and software licenses regards the built form as a derivative of the blueprints and the license applies to the structure. This means that the client is free to distribute the work.
* Architects need a license that is flexible and allows them to sell their work without any restrictions while sharing their work with other professionals.
